	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {NPHS}2 variants are the most common cause of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children {\textgreater}1 month old. Missense {NPHS}2 variants were reported to cause mistrafficking of the encoded protein, {PODOCIN}, but this conclusion was on the basis of overexpression in some nonpodocyte cell lines.
{METHODS}: We generated a series of human induced pluripotent stem cell ({iPSC}) lines bearing pathogenic missense variants of {NPHS}2 , encoding the protein changes p.G92C, p.P118L, p.R138Q, p.R168H, and p.R291W, and control lines. {iPSC} lines were also generated from a patient with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (p.R168H homozygote) and a healthy heterozygous parent. All lines were differentiated into kidney organoids. Immunofluorescence assessed {PODOCIN} expression and subcellular localization. Podocytes were transcriptionally profiled and {PODOCIN}-{NEPHRIN} interaction interrogated.
{RESULTS}: All variant lines revealed reduced levels of {PODOCIN} protein in the absence of reduced transcription. Although wild-type {PODOCIN} localized to the membrane, distinct variant proteins displayed unique patterns of subcellular protein trafficking, some unreported. P118L and R138Q were preferentially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}); R168H and R291W accumulated in the Golgi. Podocyte profiling demonstrated minimal disease-associated transcriptional change. All variants displayed podocyte-specific apoptosis, which was not linked to {ER} stress. {NEPHRIN}-{PODOCIN} colocalization elucidated the variant-specific effect on {NEPHRIN} association and hence {NEPHRIN} trafficking.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Specific variants of endogenous {NPHS}2 result in distinct subcellular {PODOCIN} localization within organoid podocytes. Understanding the effect of each variant on protein levels and localization and the effect on {NEPHRIN} provides additional insight into the pathobiology of {NPHS}2 variants.
