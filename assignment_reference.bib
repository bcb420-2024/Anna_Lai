	doi = {10.1681/ASN.2022060707},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {NPHS}2 variants are the most common cause of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children {\textgreater}1 month old. Missense {NPHS}2 variants were reported to cause mistrafficking of the encoded protein, {PODOCIN}, but this conclusion was on the basis of overexpression in some nonpodocyte cell lines.
{METHODS}: We generated a series of human induced pluripotent stem cell ({iPSC}) lines bearing pathogenic missense variants of {NPHS}2 , encoding the protein changes p.G92C, p.P118L, p.R138Q, p.R168H, and p.R291W, and control lines. {iPSC} lines were also generated from a patient with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (p.R168H homozygote) and a healthy heterozygous parent. All lines were differentiated into kidney organoids. Immunofluorescence assessed {PODOCIN} expression and subcellular localization. Podocytes were transcriptionally profiled and {PODOCIN}-{NEPHRIN} interaction interrogated.
{RESULTS}: All variant lines revealed reduced levels of {PODOCIN} protein in the absence of reduced transcription. Although wild-type {PODOCIN} localized to the membrane, distinct variant proteins displayed unique patterns of subcellular protein trafficking, some unreported. P118L and R138Q were preferentially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}); R168H and R291W accumulated in the Golgi. Podocyte profiling demonstrated minimal disease-associated transcriptional change. All variants displayed podocyte-specific apoptosis, which was not linked to {ER} stress. {NEPHRIN}-{PODOCIN} colocalization elucidated the variant-specific effect on {NEPHRIN} association and hence {NEPHRIN} trafficking.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Specific variants of endogenous {NPHS}2 result in distinct subcellular {PODOCIN} localization within organoid podocytes. Understanding the effect of each variant on protein levels and localization and the effect on {NEPHRIN} provides additional insight into the pathobiology of {NPHS}2 variants.

	abstract = {Biological data analysis often deals with lists of genes arising from various studies. The g:Profiler toolset is widely used for finding biological categories enriched in gene lists, conversions between gene identifiers and mappings to their orthologs. The mission of g:Profiler is to provide a reliable service based on up-to-date high quality data in a convenient manner across many evidence types, identifier spaces and organisms. g:Profiler relies on Ensembl as a primary data source and follows their quarterly release cycle while updating the other data sources simultaneously. The current update provides a better user experience due to a modern responsive web interface, standardised {API} and libraries. The results are delivered through an interactive and configurable web design. Results can be downloaded as publication ready visualisations or delimited text files. In the current update we have extended the support to 467 species and strains, including vertebrates, plants, fungi, insects and parasites. By supporting user uploaded custom {GMT} files, g:Profiler is now capable of analysing data from any organism. All past releases are maintained for reproducibility and transparency. The 2019 update introduces an extensive technical rewrite making the services faster and more flexible. g:Profiler is freely available at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler.},
